# WikiWhat Project - Storybook

Set up:
```
npm install
npm run storybook
```
Navigate to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)

This is our Storybook for our demo application, WikiWhat. You will be able to see the components of our app and toggle between the different states. 

Addons:
  - notes
  - Knobs
  - info
  - README
  - backgrounds

To demo these addons, go to "Test Addons" set. 

We see this as a great collaboration tool for between developers and those who may not be experienced with code. The addons (especially the knob addon) allow anyone to be able to see and point out details they may want to change regardless of coding experience.
